I have used Vector as Data Structure for the assignment ad reasons are

1. I am using class and have multiple objects and vector can store multiple objects.
2. As number of Circle as unknown and vector can change its size (vectors are dynamic)
3. Stored data can be easily accessed.

Structure for storing data is as follow

 Circle 1 ->  radius
	      area
	      cordinates -> x
			    y
 Circle 2 ->  radius
	      area
	      cordinates -> x
			    y
